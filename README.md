Fantasy Hunter was the 1st project of my Bootcamp as a Front End Developer.

Created in HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript Vanilla.

This app is a Simon Says-based video game but with more complexity. It was made with the purpose of training visual memory and reflexes. Once you run it, in a selector menu you can choose your character from 9 different ones and your nickname as a player. After that, in the jungle, your goal will be to hunt the animals in order of their appearance to demostrate your visual memory along 2 stages with 8 rounds each. In each round the appearance speed between two animals increases gradually. Stage 3 consists in defeating the final boss, an angry eagle who appears and disappears very quickly and will challenge not your visual memory but your reflexes.
